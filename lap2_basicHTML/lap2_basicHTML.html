       <p align="left"> <big> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be 
	   displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
	   scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
	   local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page 
	   semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building 
	   blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
	   embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting 
	   structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
	   HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as 
	   JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.</big></p>

      <section> 
	   <p> <big> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used
	   version throughout the 2000's was <br> HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an
	   XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including
	   GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common 
	   language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would 
	   create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to
	   HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. 
	   You'll learn more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2. Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML <br>4.01 or XHTML 
	   1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 <br> is still a draft specification, and is not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and 
	   other web-enabled devices, and is the way of the future. Therefore,<br> HTML5 is the primary language <br> taught in this course.  </big> </p>
